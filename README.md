# ReMindAR: Reconstruct Mind Autoregressively

In this work, we propose the first autoregressive (AR)-based framework for visual reconstruction from fMRI signals, built upon the Visual Autoregressive Model (VAR).

For technical details and further analysis, please see the report `ReMindAR_report.pdf`.

## ðŸ‘£What's new? 

### First autoregressive (AR)-based framework:

The model first decodes fMRI voxel data into multi-scale latent features using an MLP and upsampling modules. These features are then used to guide a visual autoregressive (VAR) model, which progressively predicts finer-scale representations and reconstructs the final image.

## General information

This repository contains Python files and Jupytor notebooks for

1. Defining the VAR model (src/VAR)
2. Training ReMindAR's VAR pipeline and obtaining initial reconstructions from brain activity (src/train_with_var.py)
3. Training ReMindAR's CLIP pipeline (src/train_with_clip.py)
4. Reconstructing images from fMRI data using the trained model (src/Reconstructions.ipynb)
5. Evaluating reconstructions against the ground truth stimuli using various low-level and high-level metrics (src/Reconstruction_Metrics.ipynb)

Besides, all the above Jupytor notebooks have corresponding python files.
